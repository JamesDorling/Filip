# Filip

Filip is a Unity game developed over the course of a few months.
Originally starting out as my final year project for University (Where it was graded at a first!), 
I have developed more in my own time to fix some of the bugs and to update the code as I learn more about programming and OOP.

## The Plot
You are a test subject armed with a boost and a grappling hook, lost in a large empty expanse with a strange voice talking to you named Filip. 
Filip is a supercomputer that has kidnapped you and is running tests on you to determine your value.
Is there hope of your escape? What happened to the previous test subjects? Will Filip stop picking on me when I fall off of the map?
Theres only one way to find out!

## How to Play
The easiest way to play this would be to go to my itch.io and download the built game here:

## Contributions
If you want to work on this game, or maybe nick some code, go ahead! Make a branch off and let me know what you are working on, and Ill 
be more than happy to accept people working on it!

As of yet nobody else has, but who knows you could be the first!

## Portfolio Highlights
I would say that the main stuff to focus on would be the way that the player works, in the filepath:
`Filip/Assets/Scripts/Player`
I would recommend checking out `grapplehook.cs`. as that took me a while with a lot of fiddling to work out,
and `movement.cs` as that took me multiple versions to work out. Quite a lot of the other scripts are small, only used for one individual item
in the game, but they are still worth checking out.

## Areas of Potential Extension
New levels would always be good! I would also say new mechanics, the sky is the limit! Multiplayer races/scoreboards would be awesome, and
removing the issue of the gun being physical would be sweet. Its something I am going to look into when I get the time, but if someone beats
me to it then please be sure to leave good commit messages so I can see how it works!
